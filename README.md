# Decentralized Reputation Protocol for DAO Contributors

The Decentralized Reputation Protocol leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to seamlessly aggregate contributor activity across multiple DAOs, providing a private and verifiable reputation score. This innovative solution enables DAO contributors to maintain their privacy while engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) by transforming reputation into a powerful financial asset.

## Understanding the Challenge

In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), contributors often struggle to establish a verifiable and private reputation that reflects their work across various platforms. Traditional reputation systems are fraught with issues such as lack of privacy, transparency concerns, and interoperability across DAOs. As a result, contributors frequently find it difficult to leverage their reputation in DeFi applications, such as obtaining loans or collateral.

## How FHE Tackles the Issue

Our solution centers on the application of **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, which empowers the secure and private computation of reputation scores without revealing sensitive contributor data. By utilizing **Zama's open-source libraries**—specifically the **Concrete SDK**—this project can perform calculations on encrypted data. This means that contributors can generate and verify their reputation scores while ensuring their work history remains confidential. 

### Core Functionalities
- **FHE Encrypted Aggregation of Contribution History:** Collect and securely compute contributors' performance across DAOs.
- **Homomorphic Computation of Reputation Scores:** Calculate a reputation score without exposing personal data.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation for DeFi Lending:** Create proofs that can be shared with lenders to access loans based on reputation.
- **Interoperability with DeFi Applications:** A straightforward interface for integrating contributor reputation into various financial applications.

## Technology Stack

- **Concrete SDK**: Provides the FHE capabilities essential for performing operations on encrypted data.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Hardhat** or **Foundry**: Development environment for deploying smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for deploying the DAO Reputation Protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Directory Structure

Here’s a quick look at the project’s directory structure:

```
DAO_Reputation_Protocol/
├── contracts/
│   └── DAO_Reputation_Protocol.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/
│   └── DAOReputationProtocol.test.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Installation Guide

Before proceeding with the installation, please ensure you have **Node.js** and **Hardhat** or **Foundry** installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Navigate to your project directory where you have downloaded the files.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install the required packages, including the Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Remember, cloning the repository or using `git clone` is **strictly forbidden**.

## Build & Run Guide

Once your installation is complete, you can compile, test, and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract to your desired network** (make sure to configure the network in `hardhat.config.js`):
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
   ```

## Example Code

Here’s a brief code snippet illustrating how to interact with the `DAO_Reputation_Protocol` smart contract to get a contributor's reputation score:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const ReputationContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("DAO_Reputation_Protocol");
    const reputation = await ReputationContract.deploy();
    await reputation.deployed();

    const contributorAddress = "0x123..."; // Replace with actual contributor address
    const score = await reputation.getReputationScore(contributorAddress);

    console.log(`Reputation Score for ${contributorAddress}: ${score.toString()}`);
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

This example demonstrates how to fetch a reputation score from the smart contract, underlining the synergy between smart contracts and Zama's FHE technology.
